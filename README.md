# Proton-64 - C64/VIC20 keyboard to USB conversion

A case designed to house a standard, unmodified C64 (or VIC20) keyboard and QMK Proton C. Keyboard is at a 9° angle.

Bottom plate has one hole to expose the Proton C's button for easy firmware updates without the need for key combos/macros.

The case is held together by 9 M2x5 screws.

Depending on your printer and build size limitations you will have to cut the model into several pieces and join them somehow.
For my print I split the design by 3 horizontally and joined the pieces using CA-glue as well as 'welding' single layer PLA sheets over the joints. 

My recommendation is to add rubber feet to the 4 bottom corners.

Also, if you're not using a QMK Proton C you need to design your own IO-plate and modify the mounting/hold-down mechanism ('X' in bottom plate) to fit your specific controller. 

## Design goals ##
- no modifications to original keyboard
- capture design language of breadbin C64
- comfortable, usable angle without adjustment possibilities (original C64 wasn't adjustable)
- print in material simulating UV damage
